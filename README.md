|[Learning Confidence for Out-of-Distribution Detection in Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04865)|Terrance DeVries, Graham W. Taylor| [python](https://github.com/uoguelph-mlrg/confidence_estimation) | This paper proposes a method of estimating confidence for neural networks for out-of-distribution detection. A few important details: budget parameter, combating excessive regularization, and retraining misclassified examples, for the architecture to work well.|

|[When Does Self-Supervision Help Graph Convolutional Networks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09136)|Yuning You, Tianlong Chen, Zhangyang Wang, Yang Shen|[Python](https://github.com/Shen-Lab/SS-GCNs)| This paper explores three schemas of incorporating self-supervision into GCNs: pretraining+finetuning, self-training, multi-task learning, and designs three self-supervision tasks on graph: node clustering, graph partitioning, and graph completion.|

|How Airbnb Tells You Will Enjoy Sunset Sailing in Barcelona? Recommendation in a Two-Sided Travel Marketplace|Liang Wu, Mihajlo Grobovic | | The paper presents Airbnb's efforts on building recommender system for two-sided maretplace. In particular, it expands the knowlege graph with location-specific concepts and utilize location features with global-local mode. |
