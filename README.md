|[Learning Confidence for Out-of-Distribution Detection in Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04865)|Terrance DeVries, Graham W. Taylor| [python](https://github.com/uoguelph-mlrg/confidence_estimation) | This paper proposes a method of estimating confidence for neural networks for out-of-distribution detection. A few important details: budget parameter, combating excessive regularization, and retraining misclassified examples, for the architecture to work well.|
